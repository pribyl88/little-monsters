# little-monsters
A practice website featuring our silly little monsters. August 15, 2022.

This project was built on day #9 of my self-study through The Odin Project (TOP), with the long-term goal of learning HTML, CSS, and Java. 

Overall I'd estimate this project was created after approximately 35 hours of self-study and practice using TOP's exercises and supplemental resources.
